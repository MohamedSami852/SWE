
Design Patterns:

1.PizzaToppings: Adds functionality (toppings) to the base pizza dynamically without modifying existing code. example Cheese, Olives, Mushrooms classes extend functionality of a any Pizza instance

2.Ensures a single instance of InventoryManager for consistent inventory accross all the project

3.payment methods (CreditCardPayme,PayPalPayment) to provide flexible options and also open for modification
